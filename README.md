# wxJapanese

Simple GUI script I created to teach myself wxPython and Japanese.
To run, simply launch

```bash
$ virtualenv venv
$ venv/source/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python japanese.py
```

Japanese questions are contained in `japanese.json`.

If left untouched, the propmt will appear at random itentervals between 5 and 15 minutes. Clicking on the system tray will pop up a question immediatly.
